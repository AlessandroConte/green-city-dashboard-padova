# Green City Dashboard – Padua 🌱🏙️

## 🌍 Overview

The **Green City Dashboard** is an ongoing data analytics project focused on exploring, processing, and visualizing **environmental data** for the city of **Padua, Italy**.
The primary goal is to analyze **air quality** through pollutants such as **PM10, PM2.5, NOx, SO2, CO, Benzene, and IPA**, and present results via **interactive dashboards**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* 📊 Collect and process official environmental datasets.
* 🔎 Analyze trends and patterns in air quality over time.
* 🖥️ Build an interactive dashboard for clear and impactful insights.

---

## 🚧 Current Status

**Work in Progress** – Data acquisition and light preprocessing have been completed.
Database integration and dashboard development are in progress.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 🗄️ **PostgreSQL** – Data storage & queries
* 🐍 **Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter)** – Data acquisition & preprocessing
* 📊 **Power BI** – Dashboard & visualization
* 🌐 **Official open data sources** – Environmental datasets

## 📌 Project Roadmap

### ✅ Completed

* **Phase 0 – Initial Setup**

  * Created GitHub repository.
  * Installed and configured PostgreSQL (via pgAdmin4).
  * Defined project structure (data/, notebooks/, scripts/, docs/).

* **Phase 1 – Data Acquisition & Light Preprocessing**

  * Collected first dataset on PM10 levels.
  * Implemented light preprocessing in Python:

    * Standardized column names.
    * Converted date/time formats.
    * Handled missing values and duplicates.
    * Sorted and saved cleaned dataset.

---

### 🔜 Upcoming

* **Phase 2 – Database Integration**

  * Import cleaned data into PostgreSQL.
  * Define relational schema for pollutants.

* **Phase 3 – Data Exploration & SQL Analysis**

  * Write analytical queries (trends, seasonality, correlations).
  * Validate results against expected environmental patterns.

* **Phase 4 – Dashboard Development (Power BI)**

  * Connect Power BI to PostgreSQL.
  * Create interactive visualizations for air quality metrics.

* **Phase 5 – Final Project Packaging**

  * Documentation & user guide.
  * Publish portfolio-ready version.
